            <center><h6>Kanya Kumari,INDIA </h6></center>
                <P> Kanyakumari is a coastal town in the state of Tamil Nadu on India's southern tip.
                <b>The meeting point of three oceans-the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.</b>
                Undoubtedly, Kanyakumari Temple, also known as Bhagavathy Amman Temple, is a highly revered pilgrimage site here and is visited by millions of tourists every year.
                <b>To everyone's surprise, the temple dates back to 3000 years and is believed to be built by Lord Parshuram.</b>
                Besides its importance as a Hindu pilgrim center, it is famous for its beautiful views of sunrise and sunset over the waters.</P>

            <p>A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. 
                It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example â€“ a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.
